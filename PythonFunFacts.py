# You can use the command ‘any(list)’ to check to see whether
# any of the elements within your list are true. If you need to check whether all of the elements are True,
# you can use the command ‘all(list)’. Both of these commands return a True if the relevant condition is
# satisfi ed, and a False if not. They do behave differently if the iterable object is empty, however. The
# command ‘all’ returns a True if the iterable is empty, whereas the command ‘any’ returns a False when
# given any empty iterable.
